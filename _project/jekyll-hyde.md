Book cover for a new edition of the _Robert Louis Stevenson_ classic "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". The design features Dr. Jekyll's alter ego manifested as his cast shadow as he walks down a London street. Because of the print budget for the run of this edition, the cover was designed to have great visual impact when printed in black and white.
