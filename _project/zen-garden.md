A responsive site theme for the popular CSS Zen Garden website, which promotes the use and abilities of CSS to style websites and separate style from content. The underwater site theme was made by solely changing the CSS included on the page, with no HTML alterations from the stock markup provided by the site. The site was designed fully responsive to look as well on mobile devices and tablets as on large desktop screens.
